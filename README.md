RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM

A  Railway Reservation System is one which helps us to reserve or cancel seats in train.When we want to travel from one place to another place.Since,it is difficult to maintain a record of all information manually,we have created it with the help of E-R diagram,DFD flowchart and many tables and forms.It consists of several steps to be followed and many forms to be maintained i.e for the convienience of the passengers.


# PROJECT SPECIFICATION
Our Project specifies all the possible attributes and features to the passengers for the quick reserved process in minimum time.For this the following attributes are there:-
	Train .No
	Train Route
	Date of Journey
	No of Seats Available
	No of Seats in Waiting
	Departure Time
	Class of Train ( Coach .No)
	Distance (K.M)
	Place (Source  To  Destination)
	Train Fare

# PROBLEM DEFINATION
We are making this Project due to many problems thst had occurred earlier:-
	Maintainence of huge amount of Database manually is very tough job due to which passengers are not getting the proper information.
	Passengers had to wait for a long time standing in a queue for the confirmation of ticket,this results in wastage of time.
	It takes a lot of work and time for cancellation.
	Passengers can’t be able to know the proper arrival and departure time which is really very inconvienient.

# SOLUTION PROVIDER
	Our Project will provide a breathfull solution i.e quick reservation and cancellation without any problem.
	Queries of trains and routes can be solved within a minute.
	No need to come in reservation centre,everyone can access this facility from anywhere. 
	Status of all possible routes and train with their appropriate fare.

# SCOPE OF SYSTEM
Scope of this System is not confined to only upto a particular city,or upto a particular state whereas all over the country.From any place at any time accessing is possible i.e 24hrs service for the people.

# LIMITATIONS 
 	Online Reservation can’t be possible at this phase.
 	If a wrong username and password is entered,an error message should be displayed.
 	If a valid username and password is entered,it should display the main menu.
 	On clicking user should get the confirmation message for reservation or cancellation by displaying a message.
 	When a new user access then a new PNR.No should generate for him.
